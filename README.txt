How to play: Java must be installed on the machine for the game to work. If you are one windows you can double click or open the file named RUNME.bat to run the game. If you are not on Windows or you possess some deep seated hatred for .bat files you can also run the game by entering java -jar CatFight.jar in the command line once you have navigated to the correct folder.


Gameplay details: Cat Fight is a 2 player fighting game. As you open the game, you will be prompted with a character select screen. Here you can choose the 
characters you and your friend would like to play as. Each player has three main stats: speed, power, and health. Speed determines the players movement speed, power determines
the players damage output and knockback, and health determines the players starting health. There are 4 options for character select: speed, power, health, and random. 
The name of the character tells you what stat will be enhanced. For example, power will have enhanced power stats over the others. Random is a wildcard pick,
the stats of the character will all be randomly decided. It can either be vastly overpowered or underpowered, depending on your luck.

Controls: The controls of the game consist of moving left and right, light punch, heavy punch, kick, and shield. Light punch is quicker than all the other moves, but outputs 
lower damage. Heavy punch has limited range, long startup frames, and long recovery frames but outputs the most damage and knockback. Shield will block all incoming attacks
except kick. Kick will deliver zero to minimal damage if the opponent isn't blocking, but it will deliver a decent amount of damage if the opponent is blocking. Kick also has a longer startup time, as its main use is to break an opponents shield.
